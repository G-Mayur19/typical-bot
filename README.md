# Syphrus
A typical bot for administration, fun, levelling and other minecraft commands.

## Instructions
Download @types/node & tsx
```cli
npm i @types/node tsx
```

**Create a folder named `Data` and create a `config.json` file!**

**Don't forget to config you package.json to your requirements!**

## Create a file named "dist" (case sensitive)

**This will contain the javascript code of your bot!**

**Run `npm run build` to convert you typescript code to javascript**

### This will be getting updates every now and then!
